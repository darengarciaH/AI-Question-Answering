Provide a short summary (200 words max) of what the AI does. Include a high-level description of system inputs and outputs.,DEA's Special Testing and Research Laboratory utilizes AI/ML techniques and has developed a robust statistical methodology including multi-variate statistical analysis tools to automatically classify the geographical region of origin of samples selected for DEA's Heroin and Cocaine signature programs. The system provides for detection of anomalies and low confidence results.,"Threat Intake Processing System (TIPS) database uses artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to accurately identify, prioritize, and process actionable tips in a timely manner. The AI used in this case helps to triage immediate threats in order to help FBI field offices and law enforcement respond to the most serious threats first.  Based on the algorithm score, highest priority tips are first in the queue for human review.","The Office of Records Management Policy uses an AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool to assess the similarity of records schedules across all Department records schedules. The tool provides clusters of similar items to significantly reduce the time that the Records Manager spends manually reviewing schedules for possible consolidation. An AI powered dashboard provides recommendations for schedule consolidation and review, while also providing the Records Manager with the ability to review by cluster or by individual record. The solution's technical approach has applicability with other domains that require text similarity analysis.",The application scans documents and looks for attorney/client privileged information. It does this based on keyword input by the system operator.
